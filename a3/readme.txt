Hello,

The code is not clean nor optmized as it redoes some of the obivous calculations
Also multiple sections of the code are repeated.
However, it does the job!
Please try m and shift m for best LOD tests.


usecase:
1. press shift m
2. adjust lod.


note: when changing regularization you have to reload the object.
note: the draw error edge would only show that of the current edge (otherwise it gets too crowded).
note: the location of the optimal point changes with the regulrization term.


Thanks,
Elias
